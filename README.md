Frameworks and Tools

Overview

This repository, mikalnolan/Frameworks-and-Tools, serves as a collection of documents, PDFs, and resources related to various mathematical and computational frameworks and tools. Currently, it includes the PDF of the "Measured-Bundle Projection Framework (MBPF)" paper, which presents a novel framework for processing data on a spindle-torus base with applications in spectral analysis and topological invariants. Additional related PDFs or tools may be included as the repository grows.
